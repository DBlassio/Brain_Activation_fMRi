# Brain_Activation_fMRi

What does the brain reveal about how we shift between calculation and narrative comprehension? Using task-based Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project, we explore how cortical activation patterns differentiate between two conditions withing the language task: a math-based reasoning task and a story comprehension task. Using data parcellated into 360 regions of interest, we investigate whether machine learning models can decode cognitive state based on these distinct functional signatures. We apply dimensionality reduction and train classifiers to distinguish between story and math trials. Our results indicate that even in reduced form, brain-wide activation patterns carry sufficient information to reliably classify task condition. This suggests that the brain engages separable, distributed networks for numerical reasoning and narrative understanding, and that these patterns are detectable at the parcel level. By integrating computational methods with neuroimaging data, this project could contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how cognitive functions such as reasoning and comprehension are mapped across the cortex.
